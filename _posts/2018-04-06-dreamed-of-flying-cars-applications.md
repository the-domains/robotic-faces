# Dreamed of flying cars applications. 

Beside typical use such as taxis, public transportation, and delivery, there is also plenty of applications, which are of great social benefit. For instance emergency services, and especially ambulance! Consider a huge congested city, where dispatchers are doing their best to route ambulances so that they can arrive on time and save human lives. Of course, modern navigational systems help, but they can't solve the main problem - congestion. I believe that when we go in three dimensions (flying) and start with the Unmanned flying vehicles from the very beginning, we can build a robust, safe and efficient transportation system, when an automated dispatching platform will make precise flight plans taking in the account plans of all flying robots in the skies. And emergency will undoubtedly benefit vastly from such system.

So I'm starting an experimental project of creating such emergency control system.
