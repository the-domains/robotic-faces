So, I have applied to the [Udacity flying cars nanodegree][0] and now am preparing myself. Udacity suggests the following courses as preparation:

* [Machine Learning][1]
* [AI for Robotics][2]
* [Programming Foundations][3]
* [C++ tutorial by Sololearn][4]
* [Linux Command Line Basics][5]
* [Statistics and Probability][6]
* [Linear Algebra][7]
* [Multivariable Calculus][8]
* [ROS Tutorials][9]

In the next few articles I will describe my opinion on those I have passed and also review some books, that I have found useful.
