I have not been here a while. But I am back and to share my thoughts on how to prepare yourself for the the robot programming. Usually you will need two languages: C++ and Python. There are a lot of courses out there and I tried there of them:

* [SoloLearn C++ tutorial][0]
* [Udacity intro to Python][1]
* [EDX Intro to computer science with Python][2]

To get into the computer science (CS) I definitely recommend EDX's course. It is deep and provide a great introduction not only to Python, but also to the CS. You will learn about algorithms and their complexity, object-oriented programming, Python itself and much more.

SoloLearn is great to get acquainted with the syntax of C++, but it won't give you much practice or understanding of core CS paradigms.

Udacity course is for absolute beginners, so if you have any experience in CS, do not waste your time.

I will try other courses and give you more reviews...;-)
